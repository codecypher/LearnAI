## IEEE Code of Ethics

Since AI/ML is software engineering and IEEE is the defacto authority on all things software and hardware related, you should be aware of its rules and standards.

You should also know about the [SWEBOK](https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering/v3) 


Here are a few key points in the IEEE Code of Ethics that all software developers should know and learn:

I. To uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities.

1.  To hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, to protect the privacy of others, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment. 

5. To seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors, to be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data, and to credit properly the contributions of others. 

6. To maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations. 


II. To treat all persons fairly and with respect, to not engage in harassment or discrimination, and to avoid injuring others.

9. to avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false or malicious actions, rumors or any other verbal or physical abuses. 


III. To strive to ensure this code is upheld by colleagues and co-workers.

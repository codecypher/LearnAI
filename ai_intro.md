# Introduction to AI


## Noteworthy Facts

- 85% or more of AI projects fail [5], [6].

- Less than 1% of AI practitioners and researchers have an advanced degree in AI [TODO].  

- 34% or more of of journal article authors admit to manipulating results [7].

- In general, the results of journal articles are irreproducible [7], [8].


## Background

As an AI/ML engineer, you should be willing to settle for “good enough” called _satisﬁcing_ rather than trying to find the “best” model or approach.

Scrum is a popular project management approach but not really a software development methodology [1].

I prefer using an iterative, agile feature-driven development (FDD) methodology where team members are able to work independently without the rigid constraints of Scrum [2].


Here are some lists of articles that covers some of the problems with **AI Engineering** which is required knowledge for any student of AI.

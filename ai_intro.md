# Introduction to AI

## Facts

- 95% or more of AI projects fail [5], [6], [9]
- 85% or more of software projects fail [11], [12]
- 90% of DevOps projects fail [13]
- 268% Higher Failure Rates for Agile Software Projects [14]

- Less than 1% of AI practitioners and researchers have an advanced degree in AI [TODO].
- 34% or more of of journal article authors admit to manipulating results [7].
- In general, the results of journal articles are irreproducible [7], [8].

## Background

As an AI/ML engineer, you should be willing to settle for “good enough” which is called _satisﬁcing_ rather than trying to find the “best” model or approach.

Scrum is a popular project management approach rather than a software development methodology [1].

I prefer using an iterative, agile feature-driven development (FDD) methodology where team members are able to work independently without the rigid constraints of Scrum [2].

Here are some lists of articles that cover some of the problems with **AI Engineering** which is required knowledge for an AI project to be successful.

## Key Concepts

The student of AI needs the following:

- A healthy dose of skepticism [4].
- Knowledge of the history and reasons that led to the _AI Winter_.
- Be aware of the hype, misinformation, and  alchemy that is common in the field of AI.

There are two guiding principles for AI engineering:

1. Occam’s Razor: The simplest algorithm that fits the data is usually the best.
2. No Free Lunch Theorem: There is no such thing as best, only good enough.

The core problems with AI engineering:

- Why AI Projects Fail?
- AI Research: Reproducibility, Fabrication, and Falsification.
- AI alchemy = hype and false claims.
- Problems with Cloud AI
- Risks of agile approach for AI projects

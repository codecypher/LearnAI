## AI Resume Buuilders

Condensing an entire job into three high-impact bullet points is no easy feat, and if you're like most humans, there is nothing you dread more than talking about yourself.

An AI resume writer  will do most of that work for you. All you need to do is fill in your job title. Then the AI resume builder will use AI (in Kickresume's case, GPT-4) to come up with relevant bullet points. You can ask the tool to generate as many bullets as you need, then choose those most relevant to your actual work experience. The tools can also write your resume summary, education, skills, and other sections.

Some examples of resume builders are Kickresume, Rezi, and Skillroads.

## AI Job Search Tools

Sorting through job listings and hunting down requirements and salary ranges can be difficult.

That's where AI job matching platforms can help: they use AI to match you with job listings likely to be a good fit for both sides, based on your skills, experience, and what you're looking for in a company or position. Platforms like Talentprise and—if you're looking for a remote position—Pyjama Jobs are good options here. Another platform, Fortay, even offers a quiz to help you narrow in on companies with the right culture fit for you.

With Talentprise, for example, you complete a series of questions on your preferences for a job (like location, willingness to relocate, remote vs. in-office, and when you're available to start) and fill out your "biography" which covers resume stuff like work experience, skills, and education. Then, you complete the Talentprise assessment which measures personality and work traits, along with your values and motivation, to create a holistic profile for you.

Then Talentprise's AI matches you with relevant job listings on the site and surfaces your profile to those recruiters. So once you complete your profile, "applying" to best-fit jobs is as close to a passive endeavor as you could hope for.


[Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/lp/ats-resume)

LazyApply  can massively speed up the process and eliminate typing and retyping of things like the start and end dates for some company you worked for ten years ago multiple times a day when you are job hunting.


## AI Resume Optimization Tools

Today, many recruiters and hiring managers rely on algorithms and automated applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan applicant resumes for the right keywords. If those terms do not feature in your resume, you may get kicked to the "no thanks" pile well before a human ever sets eyes on your application.

AI optimization tools like Jobscan and SkillSyncer ensure your resume makes it past discerning ATS algorithms and into the "interview please" pile.

These tools compare your resume, cover letter, and even LinkedIn profile against the keywords found in the job listing you select. They rate how well your resume matches with the role and offer suggestions for how to better optimize your resume for each job.

Writing personalized cover letters for each role is time consuming when applying to jobs—but it's also necessary to make an impression. AI-powered cover letter generators like Kickresume and CoverDoc.ai make the process a whole lot faster and easier.

Provide some basic details about the job you are applying for, your writing style, and your LinkedIn profile, and the tool will generate a personalized cover letter draft for you.

## AI-powered Interview Coaching Tools

AI-powered interview coaching tools such as Interview Warmup from Google can help you practice and get feedback in a low-stakes environment.

These tools simulate a real interview and give you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve, like body language, tone of voice, or specific interview questions you struggled with.

By practicing with these tools, you will feel more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews. You'll also have a better sense of what to expect, which can help calm your nerves and let you focus on nailing that first impression.


## AI-powered Negotiation Tools

Negotiating your salary can be a fraught process—especially if you are not sure what a fair salary range looks like for your position and experience.

AI-powered compensation tools like Payscale use AI to analyze data from thousands of job listings and salary surveys to provide you with an estimate of what you should earn based on details like the job title and your experience, education, and location.

AI-powered compensation tools can also offer insight into the benefits and perks you should ask for—like flexible hours or remote work options. Plus, you can fill out granular information on any existing job offers you have to see how they stack up.

By using these tools to research salaries before you sit down at the negotiating table, you will have a better sense of what to expect and be better equipped to make a strong case for what you deserve.

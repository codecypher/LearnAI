# The Alchemy of AI


## Background

The student of AI needs the following:

- A healthy dose of skepticism [4].
- Knowledge of the history and reasons that led to the _AI Winter_.
- Be aware of the hype, misinformation, and  alchemy that is common in the field of AI.

The two guiding principles of AI engineering are:

1. Occam's Razor
2. No Free Lunch Theorem

## Integrating LLMs in a Software System

Despite the many advantages of integrating LLMs into existing software, there are many risks that need to be considered [10].

> The tendency to make things up is holding chatbots back. But that’s just what they do. (MIT Technology Review)

- Computational costs of training models and during model inferences due to heavy reliance on high-end GPUs and TPUs

- Making frequent API calls can be expensive, especially for high-traffic applications

- If sensitive data is sent to an LLM, it might be processed, stored, and exposed to another user, especially when the LLM being utilized is accessible to the public

- Aside from properly fine-tuned custom models, most LLMs can only provide open-ended and generic responses and cannot provide domain-based knowledge

- Training LLMs require high energy usage, which can lead to high carbon emissions and environmental pollution

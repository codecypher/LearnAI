# Computer Vision

## Overview

Computer Vision (CV) is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos [1].

Many popular computer vision applications involve trying to recognize things in photographs [1]:

- **Object Classification:** What broad category of object is in this photograph?

- **Object Identification:** Which type of a given object is in this photograph?

- **Object Verification:** Is the object in the photograph?

- **Object Detection:** Where are the objects in the photograph?

- **Object Landmark Detection:** What are the key points for the object in the photograph?

- **Object Segmentation:** What pixels belong to the object in the image?

- **Object Recognition:** What objects are in this photograph and where are they?

- Facial Recognition



## Image segmentation

**Semantic segmentation** is the process to allocate a semantic label to every pixel present in an image [5]. 

For example, traffic sign detection aims to classify each pixel as a car, a pedestrian, or a road sign.

Semantic segmentation (SS) is different from standard segmentation tasks which labels the pixels according to their physical properties (their color). 

SS aims at annotating each pixel with its object label. The algorithm to identify objects works under the learning architecture of neural networks.


Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image (still images and video images) into multiple segments. These segments are homogeneous regions in terms of content and characteristics. Segmentation is used in computer vision and image processing tasks, such as object recognition and scene understanding.

There are two common types of Image Segmentation [5]:

- Semantic Segmentation
- Instant Segmentation



## Overview

The following sections discuss several important CV concepts [2]:

- Image Data Handling
- Image Data Preparation
- Image Data Augmentation

- Image Classification
- Object Recognition
- Object Classification
- Object Detection



## Image Data Handling

For CV projects, it can be confusing to determine which library to choose to read and manipulate image datasets [6] [7].

The `sklearn.datasets` package embeds some small toy datasets which can be accessed using the dataset loading utilities [8]. 

The Keras deep learning library provides access to four standard computer vision datasets [10].

The Keras deep learning library provides a sophisticated API for loading, preparing, and augmenting image data [9]. 

### NHWC vs HCHW

You will often encounter obscure image format issues going between Linux and macOS (NHWC vs HCHW) [4]. 



## Kaggle Download

We can download datasets from Kaggle using an API token. 

```bash
  %%capture
  !pip install kaggle

  # upload your tokn
  from google.colab import files
  import time

  uploaded = files.upload()
  time.sleep(3)

  # download directly from kaggle
  !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
  !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
  !kaggle competitions download "dogs-vs-cats"
```

```py
  import zipfile

  # unzip the downloaded folder into a new folder
  data_zip = "/content/dogs-vs-cats.zip"
  data_dir = "./data"
  data_zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(data_zip,"r")
  data_zip_ref.extractall(data_dir)

  # unzip the test subfolder
  test_zip = "/content/data/test1.zip"
  test_dir = "./data"
  test_zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(test_zip,"r")
  test_zip_ref.extractall(test_ 

  # unzip the train subfolder
  train_zip = "/content/data/train.zip"
  train_dir = "./data"
  train_zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(train_zip,"r")
  train_zip_ref.extractall(train_dir)
```

### Structure and Populate Subfolders

To facilitate the management of the dataset, we create an easy-to-manage folder structure.

The goal is to have a folder called `train` that will contain the subfolders dog and cat which will obviously contain all the images of the respective pets.

The same thing should be done for the validation folder.

```py
  import os
  import glob

  dat_dir = "/content/data"

  # create training dir
  training_dir = os.path.join(data_dir,"training")
  if not os.path.isdir(training_dir):
    os.mkdir(training_dir)

  # create dog in training
  dog_training_dir = os.path.join(training_dir,"dog")
  if not os.path.isdir(dog_training_dir):
    os.mkdir(dog_training_dir)

  # create cat in training
  cat_training_dir = os.path.join(training_dir,"cat")
  if not os.path.isdir(cat_training_dir):
    os.mkdir(cat_training_dir)

  # create validation dir
  validation_dir = os.path.join(data_dir,"validation")
  if not os.path.isdir(validation_dir):
    os.mkdir(validation_dir)

  # create dog in validation
  dog_validation_dir = os.path.join(validation_dir,"dog")
  if not os.path.isdir(dog_validation_dir):
    os.mkdir(dog_validation_dir)

  # create cat in validation
  cat_validation_dir = os.path.join(validation_dir,"cat")
  if not os.path.isdir(cat_validation_dir):
  os.mkdir(cat_validation_dir)
```

Now we shuffle the data and populate the new  subfolders.

```py
  import shutil

  split_size = 0.80
  cat_imgs_size = len(glob.glob("/content/data/train/cat*"))
  dog_imgs_size = len(glob.glob("/content/data/train/dog*"))

  for i,img in enumerate(glob.glob("/content/data/train/cat*")):
    if i < (cat_imgs_size * split_size):
      shutil.move(img,cat_training_dir)
    else:
      shutil.move(img,cat_validation_dir)

  for i,img in enumerate(glob.glob("/content/data/train/dog*")):
    if i < (dog_imgs_size * split_size):
      shutil.move(img,dog_training_dir)
    else:
      shutil.move(img,dog_validation_dir)
```

### Plot some image examples

```py
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import cv2

  from IPython.core.pylabtools import figsize

  samples_dog = [os.path.join(dog_training_dir,np.random.choice(os.listdir(dog_training_dir),1)[0]) for _ in range(8)]
  samples_cat = [os.path.join(cat_training_dir,np.random.choice(os.listdir(cat_training_dir),1)[0]) for _ in range(8)]

  nrows = 4
  ncols = 4

  fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows,ncols,figsize = (10,10))
  ax = ax.flatten()

  for i in range(nrows*ncols):
    if i < 8:
      pic = plt.imread(samples_dog[i%8])
      ax[i].imshow(pic)
      ax[i].set_axis_off()
    else:
      pic = plt.imread(samples_cat[i%8])
      ax[i].imshow(pic)
      ax[i].set_axis_off()
      plt.show()
```



## Exploratory Data Analysis for CV

There are four steps to perform before starting image processing tasks [11]:

1. Check the size of the images in the dataset. 

2. Check the blurriness of the images in the dataset. 

3. Check the color distribution of the images in the dataset. 

4. Check for there is class imbalance. 

### Check the size of the images

The first thing you could probably do right after extracting the zip folder is check the size of the images. 

If your image dataset is huge, you could probably consider writing several lines of code to do it for you.

```py
import cv2

# Read the image file
image = cv2.imread("image.png")

# Read the height and width of the image
height, width, shape = image.shape
```

```py
import cv2

dataset_folder = "/path/to/image/dataset/folder"

# Assuming this is a classification task and
# your dataset has multiple classes
folders = os.listdir(dataset_folder)
images = []
image_shapes = []
for folder in folders:
  folder_path = os.path.join(dataset_folder, folder)
  for path in os.listdir(folder_path):
    image_path = os.path.join(os.path.join(dataset_folder, folder), path)
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Convert to RGB as OpenCV uses BGR
    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)  
    images.append(image)
    
    # Obtain shape of each image and store them in an array
    (width, height) = image.shape[1], image.shape[0]
    image_shapes.append((width, height))
    
# Return only unique shapes
unique_shapes = list(set(image_shapes))
```

### Check the blurriness of the images

There could be times when a blurred image could sneak into a well-prepared image dataset and ruin your experience of exploratory data analysis. 

A simple Laplacian function from OpenCV can do the trick for us. 

```py
import cv2

def variance_of_laplacian(image):
  return cv2.Laplacian(image, cv2.CV_64F).var()
```
  
The variance of the Laplacian returns a numeric focus measure. With a threshold, we are able to tell if an image is considered blurry. 

We can pick a few clear images and compute the variance of their Laplacian to get an average of thresholds to determine what is considered non-blurry. Then, any images with a score above that value will be removed. 

There are ways to fix the blurriness of images such as smoothing and sharpening but removing blurry images will save you a lot of time, assuming you have a large dataset. 

### Check the color distribution

Color distribution can be important if your project is related to the color features such as differentiating between green plants of different species. 

Since the colors tend to overlap, understanding which channel in each color space stands out from the rest or gives a particular weight is essential. 

We can try getting the mean of the R, G, and B channel of the RGB color space using the code below. 

```py
# Obtain the mean of the R channel of the RGB space of the image
mean_r_values = []
for i in range(len(images)):
  mean_r_value = np.mean(images[i][:, :, 0])
  mean_r_values.append(mean_r_value)

# Obtain the mean of the G channel of the RGB space of the image
mean_g_values = []
for i in range(len(images)):
  mean_g_value = np.mean(images[i][:, :, 1])
  mean_g_values.append(mean_g_value)

# Obtain the mean of the B channel of the RGB space of the image
mean_b_values = []
for i in range(len(images)):
  mean_b_value = np.mean(images[i][:, :, 2])
  mean_b_values.append(mean_b_value)

# Obtain the mean of all channels of the RGB space of the image
mean_values = []
for i in range(len(images)):
  mean_value = np.mean(images[i])
  mean_values.append(mean_value)
```

Then, a simple plot of each mean value array will allow us to explore the color distribution in more detail which should give you an overview of the color features that you are able to extract later on.

### Check for class imbalance

Class imbalance is a crucial step in computer vision projects.

In real-world projects, balanced datasets are hard to come by which will result in the accuracy of a model on a certain class being higher than that on the other class.

The problem comes if there is a class imbalance. 

Suppose you have two classes, class dog and class cat and we find that there are significantly more images in the dog class.

There are two things we can do:

1. We can try to reduce the number of images in the dog category until both classes are balanced. 

2.  We can try to increase the number of images in the cat category until both classes are balanced. 

If the number of images of both classes is sufficient, the first solution is hassle-free. 

However, if we have no choice but to increase the number of images, data augmentation is the way to go.

We could try any of the following methods:

- Rotation
- Flip
- Translation
- Convolution



## Object Recognition

_Object recognition_ is a general term to describe a collection of related computer vision tasks that involve identifying objects in digital images.

_Image classification_ involves predicting the class of an object in an image.

_Object localization_ refers to identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing a bounding box around them. 

_Object detection_ combines these two tasks and localizes and classifies one or more objects in an image.

We will be using the term _object recognition_ broadly to encompass both image classification (what object classes are present in the image) and object detection (localize all objects present in the image).

We can distinguish between these three computer vision tasks:

- **Image Classification:** Predict the type or class of an object in an image.

Input: An image with a single object such as a photograph.
Output: A class label (one or more integers that are mapped to class labels).

- **Object Localization:** Locate the presence of objects in an image and indicate their location with a bounding box.

Input: An image with one or more objects, such as a photograph.
Output: One or more bounding boxes (defined by a point, width, and height).

- **Object Detection:** Locate the presence of objects with a bounding box and types or classes of the located objects in an image.

Input: An image with one or more objects, such as a photograph.
Output: One or more bounding boxes and a class label for each bounding box.


- **Object segmentation:** Instances of recognized objects are indicated by highlighting the specific pixels of the object instead of a coarse bounding box which is sometimes called _object instance segmentation_ or _semantic segmentation_.

Figure: Overview of Object Recognition Computer Vision Tasks

Most of the recent innovations in image recognition problems have come as part of participation in the ILSVRC tasks which is an annual academic competition with a separate challenge for each of three problem types: image classification, object localization, and object detection. 

- Image classification: Algorithms produce a list of object categories present in the image.

- Single-object localization: Algorithms produce a list of object categories present in the image and an axis-aligned bounding box indicating the position and scale of one instance of each object category.

- Object detection: Algorithms produce a list of object categories present in the image along with an axis-aligned bounding box indicating the position and scale of every instance of each object category.

## Object Detection

The approach will depend on the goal but most common object detection projects are classification apps which try to determine the counts of types of objects (pedestrian/vehicle).

Object detection involves identifying the presence, location, and type of one or more objects in a given photograph.

**Object detection** involves building upon the methods for _object classification_ (what are they), _object localization_ (what are their extent), and _object recognition_ (where are they).

Object detection combines all these tasks and draws a bounding box around each object of interest in the image and assigns them a class label. 


Yolo is the latest approach to object detection and there is a version that can run on raspi. 

Yolo is supposed to be easier to setup/use and have faster performance.

## Pretrained CV Models

### VGG

Given a photograph of an object, determine which of 1,000 specific objects the photograph shows.

A competition-winning model for this task is the VGG model by researchers at Oxford. 

What is important about this model (besides capability of classifying objects in photographs) is that the model weights are freely available and can be loaded and used in your own models and applications.

The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is an annual computer vision competition. Each year, teams compete on two tasks. 

The first is to detect objects within an image coming from 200 classes which is called _object localization_. 

The second is to classify images, each labeled with one of 1000 categories which is called _image classification_.

### Residual Networks (ResNet)

After the first CNN-based architecture (AlexNet) that win the ImageNet 2012 competition, every subsequent winning architecture uses more layers in a deep neural network to reduce the error rate which works for less number of layers.

[Residual Networks (ResNet)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/residual-networks-resnet-deep-learning/)

When we increase the number of layers, there is a common problem in deep learning called Vanishing/Exploding gradient which causes the gradient to become 0 or too large. Thus, when we increase the number of layers, the training and test error rate also increases.

### Residual Block

In order to solve the problem of the vanishing/exploding gradient, ResNet introduced the concept called Residual Network which uses a technique called _skip connections_. 

The skip connection skips training from a few layers and connects directly to the output.

OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. 

OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. 

OpenCV can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or eve handwriting.

### openpilot

The openpilot repo is an open-source driver assistance system that performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported car makes, models, and model years. 

However, you will need to buy their product and install it on your car and it is not completely DIY but reduces the effort.

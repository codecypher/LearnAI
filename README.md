# LearnAI

If you are like me and try to follow the principles of DRY, KISS, Design Patterns, Occam’s Razor, and other software engineering best practices then this repo is for you!

## Noteworthy

> Don't reinvent the wheel (DRTW)

> **Occam’s Razor:** The simplest algorithm that fits the data is usually the best. Therefore, avoid focusing on SOTA algorithms.

> Complex theories do not work, simple algorithms do — Vladimir Vapnik

> No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT): There is no such thing as “best”.

**No Free Lunch Theorem:** When the performance of all optimization methods is averaged across all conceivable problems, they all perform equally well. Thus, no single optimal algorithm exists.

> If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything - Ronald Coase.

> Since 85% or more of artificial intelligence  projects fail, AI is not a field where _the Star Trek approach_ is appropriate which includes the use of SOTA algoritnns and techniques for solving real-world problems and/or commercial applications. In a nutshell, KISS.

> Software Half-Life: The frameworks that help us build software in half the time become outdated in half the time.


## Background

As an AI/ML engineer, you should be willing to settle for “good enough” rather than trying to finding the “best” model or approach.

Scrum is a popular project management approach but not really a software development methodology [1]. I prefer using an iterative, agile feature-driven development (FDD) methodology where team members are able to work independently without the rigid constraints of Scrum [2].

This repo contains notes from various articles and other resources on a variety of topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

The intended audience for this repo is the undergraduate (junior or senior) or graduate student in computer science. It should be a supplement to an undergraduate or graduate textbook on machine learning (ML) [3] and artificial intelligence (AI) [4] or one of the **Recommended Booksx on AI** given below.

Whether or not you find this repo useful will depend on your style of learning and taking notes.

This is a work in progress, so there is probably some content missing and the content will be changing.

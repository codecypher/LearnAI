## Guiding Principles for AI

**Occam’s Razor:** The simplest algorithm that fits the data is usually the best.

**No Free Lunch Theorem:** There is no such thing as best, only good enough.


The field of AI requires:

1. A healthy dose of skepticism. 
2. A change in mindset from "best" to "good enough". 


> If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything - Ronald Coase

> Complex theories do not work, simple algorithms do — Vladimir Vapnik

> AI is not about implementing algorithms. Any competent software engineer can implement any algorithm.

> Don't reinvent the wheel (DRTW)


The quote from Ronald Coase tells us that most any model can be made to fit the data using a brute-force approach which is a naive, unscientific approach to AI engineering. 

In a data-centric approach, the data should drive the model selection process. Therefore, SOTA algorithms such as DL and LLM should be our last choice only after all simpler algorithms have been shown to perform poorly on the dataset. 

Software developers and even companies seem obsessed with using a model-centric, brute-force approach to apply the latest complex SOTA algorithms with no regard to accuracy or the scientific method, espcially when simpler algorithms often perform better with much less effort.

## Background

This repo contains notes from various articles and other resources on a variety of topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

The intended audience for this repo is the undergraduate (junior or senior) or graduate student in computer science. It should be a supplement to an undergraduate or graduate textbook on machine learning (ML) [3] and artificial intelligence (AI) [4] or one of the **Recommended Books on AI** given below.

Whether or not you find this repo useful will depend on your style of learning and taking notes.

This is a work in progress, so there is probably some content missing and the content will be changing.

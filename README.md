# LearnAI

If you are like me and try to follow the principles of DRY, KISS, Design Patterns, Occam’s Razor, and other software engineering best practices then this repo is for you!

## Learning Paths

- Level-0 (Beginner)
- Level-1 (Advanced)
- Level-2 (Expert)


## Noteworthy Facts

- 85% or more of AI projects fail.

- Less than 1% of AI practitioners and researchers have an advanced degree in AI.

- 34% or more of of journal article authors admit to manipulating results.

- In general, the results of journal articles are irreproducible.


## Noteworthy Quotes

> Software Half-Life: The frameworks that help us build software in half the time become outdated in half the time.

> I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you're not in this world to live up to mine - Bruce Lee


## Guiding Principles for AI

**Occam’s Razor:** The simplest algorithm that fits the data is usually the best. Therefore, avoid focusing on SOTA algorithms.

**No Free Lunch Theorem:** When the performance of all optimization methods is averaged across all conceivable problems, they all perform equally well. Thus, no single optimal algorithm exists.

> Occam's razor: the simplest algorithm that fits the data ia usually the best. 

> No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT): There is no such thing as “best”.

> If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything - Ronald Coase.

> Complex theories do not work, simple algorithms do — Vladimir Vapnik

> Don't reinvent the wheel (DRTW)


## Background

As an AI/ML engineer, you should be willing to settle for “good enough” rather than trying to finding the “best” model or approach.

Scrum is a popular project management approach but not really a software development methodology [1]. I prefer using an iterative, agile feature-driven development (FDD) methodology where team members are able to work independently without the rigid constraints of Scrum [2].

This repo contains notes from various articles and other resources on a variety of topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

The intended audience for this repo is the undergraduate (junior or senior) or graduate student in computer science. It should be a supplement to an undergraduate or graduate textbook on machine learning (ML) [3] and artificial intelligence (AI) [4] or one of the **Recommended Booksx on AI** given below.

Whether or not you find this repo useful will depend on your style of learning and taking notes.

This is a work in progress, so there is probably some content missing and the content will be changing.

## Tutorials and Books

Choosing an ML learning resource is primarliy a matter of personal preference. In geneal, I recommend that you refer to more than one resource (other than scikit-learn, tensorflow, and PyTorch documentation) when learning ML.

## Consulting and Freelance

If you ever do consulting or freelance work in the U.S. for $$, you should be aware that there are legal implications and I found [TODO] to be a clear, concise resource on the topic. I am sure there are similar rules and regulations in the EU and elsewhere.

# Audio

## Python Packages

Examples of audio data science projects are sentiment prediction, speech-to-text prediction, and music generation.

The article [1] discusses three Audio Data Science Project Python packages. 

### Magenta

Magenta is an open-source Python package built on top of TensorFlow to manipulate image and music data to train a machine learning model with the generative model as the output.

Magenta does not provide clear API references for learning, but they do provide a lot of research demo and collaborator notebooks.

### Librosa

Librosa is a Python package developed for music and audio analysis. 

Librosa is specific on capturing the audio information to be transformed into a data block. However, the documentation and example are good to understand how to work with audio data science projects.

### pyAudioAnalysis

pyAudioAnalysis is a Python package for audio analysis tasks such as:

- Extract Audio Features
- Train machine learning model for audio segmentation
- Classification of unknown audio
- Emotion recognition with a Regression model
- Dimensional Reduction for audio data visualization

There is a lot that can be done with this package.

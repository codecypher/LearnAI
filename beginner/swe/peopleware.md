Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams

Tom Demarco, 2nd ed., 1999.


# Part I Managing the Human Resource

## Chapter 1

Out of 500+ project histories, 25% of projects that lasted 25 work-years or more failed to complete. 

> The High-Tech Illusion!

The major problems of our work are not so much technological as _sociological_ in nature.

But managers manage as though technology were their principal concern.  They are forever on the lookout for a technical whiz-bang that promises to automate away part of their work.  

The most strongly people-oriented aspects of their responsibility are often given the lowest priority.



## Chapter 2

Development is inherently different from production.

> Encourage people to make some errors.

The view that managers provide all the thinking and the people underneath them just carry out their bidding.

There is nothing more discouraging to any worker than the sense that his own motivation is inadequate and has to be "supplemented" by that of the boss [or contractor].

> Managers go to great lengths to convince themselves that noone is irreplacible.

> Uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective. It is something to be cultivated.


## Chapter 3

Spanish vs English Management Theory

_Productivity_ ought to mean achieving more in an hour of pay, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay (unpaid overtime).

> Overtime for salaried workers is a figment of the naive manager's imagination.

> Noone can consistently work more than forty hours with the level of intensity required for creative work.

> You need to take turnover into account when you set out to attain higher productivity.

Most organizations cannot tell you what replacement of an experienced worker costs.

> Productivity has to be defined as benefit / cost.

> People under time pressure do not work better; they just work faster.

> To work faster, they have to sacrifice the quaility of the product and their own job satisfaction.


## Chapter 4

We all tend to tie our self-esteem strongly to the _quality_ of the product we produce -- not the quantity. 

Managers jeopardize product quality by setting **unreachable deadline**.

To pressure people into delivering a product that does not measure up to their own quality standards is a mistake.

> Quality (far beyond that required by the end user) is a means to higher productivity.


## Chapter 5

**Parkinson's Law:** Work expands to fill the time alloted for it.

Bureaucracies give little job satisfaction to their workers.

> Projects for which there were no estimates had the highest productivity of all.

**Corollary to Parkinson's Law:** Organizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day.


## Chapter 6

The Seven Sirens

The false hopes engendered by easy technological nonsolutions are like those Sirens that tempted poor Odysseus. Each one reaches out to you with her own beguiling message, an attractive fallacy that leads nowhere. As long as you believe them, you’re going to be reluctant to do the hard work necessary to build a healthy corporate culture.”

### 7 False Hopes of Software Development

1. There is some new trick you have missed that could send productivity soaring.

2. Other managers are getting gains of 100% or more.

The typical magical tool that is touted to you is focused on the coding and testing part of the life cycle.  But even if coding and testing went away entirely, you could not expect a gain of 100%.  

There is still all the analysis, negotiation, specification, training, acceptance testing, conversion, and cut-over to be done.

3. Technology is moving so swiftly that you are being passed by.

Most of what you do is not high-tech work.

We still spend most of our time working on requirements and specification which are the low-tech part of our work.

4. Changing languages (such as Java) will give you huge gains.

Programming languages only impact the implementation part of the project.  It might give you a 5% gain but no more.

5. Because of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately.

The much talked about _software backlog_ is a myth.  

We all know that projects cost a lot more at the end than what we expected them to cost at the beginning.  

The typical project that is stuck in the mythical backlog is there because it has barely enough benefit to justify building it.

6. You automate everything else; isn't it about time you automated away your software development staff?

This is another variation of the high-tech illusion: the belief that software developers do easily automatable work.  

Their principal work is human communication to organize the users' expressions of needs into formal procedure. That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle.

7. Your people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure -- no, they will just enjoy it less.

**Key Idea:** The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

# Part II The Office Environment
  

## Chapter 7

Provide some areas where a conversation can take place without disturbing others (NOT a cubicle).

Bad Examples:

1. New office space has a cubicle as a meeting area.
    
2. Managers who leave their doors open during meetings.
    
3. Dilbert is popular because it pokes fun at the cubicle.
    
4. Would you have been able to study in a cubicle?
    
5. The PA system.
    
6. How much do you save in office furniture? How much do you lose in productivity?

Office space should be considered an investment rather than an expense.

The cost of workspace for one developer is a small percentage of the salary paid to the developer.

You will save a small amount on workspace but it will cost you much more in lost productivity.

7. I get the most/best work done after 5pm when everyone has gone for the day.

People work better in natural light.


## Chapter 8

Coding War Games: Productivity Factors

### 3 rules of thumb

1. The best people outperformed the worst by about 10:1
   
There is also a 10:1 difference in productivity among software organizations.
   
Something about their environment and corporate culture is failing to attract and keep good people or is making it impossible for even good people to work effectively.
   
2. The best people were about 2.5 x better than the median performer.

3. The half that are better-than-median performers out-performed the other half by more than 2:1.

The following factors have little or no affect on performance:

- Language
- Years of experience
- Number of defects: In fact, the zero-defect workers performed better on average.
- Salary


### Chapter 9

The total investment in the worker could easily be 20 times the cost of his or her workplace (20:1).

Workers who reported that their workplace was acceptably quiet were 1/3 more likely to deliver zero-defect work.


## Chapter 10

**Myth:** Work accomplished is proportional to the number of paid hours worked.


## Chapter 13
 
Windows!


----------



# Part III The Right People

In the next four chapters, we will attempt to undo the damage of the manager-as-strategist view, and replace it with an approach that encourages you to court success with the following formula. 

### Formula for success

1. Get the right people. 
2. Make them happy so they do not want to leave.
3. Turn them loose.


### Chapter 14
 
Corporate culture is unhealthy:

1. Pressure to hire/promote workers who look, act, and think like everyone else (do what they are told -- a perfect drone; "Borg").
  
2. Sign of insecurity on the part of management.
  
3. Why do almost all managers wear suits?

> The most successful manager is the one who shakes up the local entropy to bring in the right people and let them be themselves, even though they may deviate from the corporate norm.


## Chapter 15

Leadership as a Work-Extraction Mechanism

One of those dreadful motivational posters tells us: The speed of the leader sets the rate of the pack.

This kind of leadership is a work-extraction mechanism. Its purpose is to enhance not the _quality_ of the experience but the _quantity_. 

The reason you are being led is to get you to work harder, stay longer, and stop goofing off.


## Chapter 16

It would be ludicrous to think of hiring a juggler without first seeing him perform. 

Yet when you set out to hire an engineer or a designer or a programmer or a group manager, you don’t ask to see a design or a program or anything. In fact, the interview is just talk.

> There seems to be an unwritten rule that says it is okay to ask the candidate about past work but not to ask to see it.

Aptitude Tests (Erghhhh)

Our industry has had a long, irregular flirtation with the idea of aptitude testing. In the sixties, the idea was positively in vogue.

The tests measure the wrong thing.

Holding an Audition

The idea is simple. 

You ask a candidate to prepare a ten- or fifteen-minute presentation on some aspect of past work.



## Chapter 17

Team jell takes time, and, during much of that time, the composition of the team can’t be changing. 

If you need to use a reactive strategy of contract labor, your team will probably never jell. In fact, the workforce you manage almost certainly will not be a team at all.


## Chapter 18

Continuous Partial Attention

In the most-simplistic terms, the new generational divide in your organization is about attention: Young people divide theirs while their older colleagues tend to focus on one or possibly two tasks at a time.

A generation that grew up studying with music blaring on their iPods is an illustration of “continuous partial attention.”

The problem is that continuous partial attention is the exact opposite of flow. 

A flow state is essential for getting real work done which means you need to set limits on how attention may be divided. You need to make your youngest workers understand the difference between spending 2 percent of their workday on Facebook in a single block of time and spending 2 percent of their attention all day on Facebook. 

Articulate the contract

Articulating the contract to young workers is going to be essential to give them a chance to fit in. 

If work needs to be done in flow, then your people need to be ready to focus. 

Continuous-partial-attention periods have to be defined as personal time off, acceptable within limits during the workday. The rest of the workday is for work.”

Continuous partial attention at meetings is similarly destructive of whatever the legitimate purposes may be of the meeting. Even your older workers may be prone to doing e-mail and other tasks during meetings. Think of imperfect attention at meetings to be more about a dysfunctional meeting culture than about anyone’s work ethic. 


## Chapter 19

### Questions

- What annual employee turnover has your organization experienced over the last few years?

- How much does it cost on average to replace a person who leaves?

- How much does it cost on average to hire a contractor?

### Short-term Perspective

- Optimize for the short term, exploit people (such as contractors), cheat on the workplace, and do nothing to conserve its very lifeblood, the peopleware that is its only real asset.

- Agricultural analogy: We would eat our seed corn immediately and all starve next year.

> In companies with low turnover, the hierarchy is low and flat.

> It is always cheaper in the short run to fire the person who needs retraining and hire someone else (such as a contractor) who already has the required skills. The best organizations do not do this.

## Chapter 20
 
- expense/investment/capitalize

- bottom-line = shortsighted; fails to preserve long-term investment

> Companies that downsize are admitting that their upper management has blown it.

# Part IV Growing Productive Teams

Good work experiences always have a measure of challenge to them.

## Chapter 21

> team + jell = momentum

Professional workers are supposed to accept their employer's goals as a condition of employment. 

Believing that workers will automatically accept organizational goals is the sign of naïve management. 

Throughout the upper ranks of the organization, there is marvelous ingenuity to be sure that each manager has a strong personal incentive to accept the corporate goals. At the bottom (where the real work is performed) this ingenuity fails. 

Managers do not take particular care to foster jelled teams. 

- Part of the reason is an imperfect understanding of why teams matter.  

- The insecure manager is threatened by them.

> The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment.

Signs of a Jelled Team

The most important characteristic is low turnover during projects and in the middle of well-defined tasks.

- strong sense of identity.
- sense of eliteness (uniqueness) on a good team. 
- joint ownership of the product
- people enjoy their work


## Chapter 22

The value of jelled teams will be obvious to you if you have already had the enjoyable experience of working on one. 

Finding the last bug was hard, but some testers were better than others. The company formed a group of these particularly talented testers and gave them the charter to do final testing on critical software before it was sent to the customers. Thus was born the legendary Black Team.


## Chapter 23

When you are stuck trying to solve a problem, deBono suggests that rather than looking for ways to achieve your goal, look for ways to achieve the exact opposite of your goal.

### Teamicide

- defensive management
- bureaucracy
- physical separation
- time fragmentation
- reduced product quality
- phony deadlines
- clique control

### Defensive Management

- Only his own judgement was competent; anyone else's was suspect
- Prescriptive Methodologies
- Technical interference by the manager

**Solution:**

- Let them make some mistakes
- Override a decision rarely

### Bureaucracy

Paperwork accounts for more than 30% of the cost of producing a product. 

> paperwork = pure bureaucracy = mindless paper pushing

**Physical Separation:** When they are all on the same team, they tend to go into quiet mode at the same time. 

**Fragmentation of Time:** Bad for teams, bad for efficiency. 

**Quality-Reduced Product:** The steps we take to deliver a product in less time result in lower quality. 

**Clique Control:** The team phenomenon is something that occurs only at the bottom of the hierarchy. 


## Chapter 24
 
- motivational accessories: managment believes these virtues can be improved with posters rather than hard work and managerial talent.

- extended overtime reduces productivity


## Chapter 25
 
- competition inhibits team jell
- peer-coaching
- sports team as a metaphor is a bad idea. 
- Team: the success of the individual is tied to the success of the whole. 


Managerial actions that have teamicidal side effects:

- annual salary or merit reviews
- management by objectives
- recognizing individual accomplishment
- performance awards
- performance measurements


## Chapter 27
 
> Open Kimono: trust the people under you and don't second-guess. 

Visual supervision is a joke for development workers.

Visual supervision is for prisoners!


## Chapter 28
 
chemistry = good managers devote their time to building and maintaining healthy chemistry. 

The judgement that a still imperfect product is "close enough" is the death knell for a jelling team.

closure = successful completion of work assigned. 

Divide the work into _milestones_ and make sure that each piece has a substantial demonstration of completion.

If you could effect some change in the people you manage and make them more productive and goal-oriented but also less controllable, would you do it?

> If a team knits, don't break it up!

Teams are made up of peers, equals that function as equals.

> There is no hierarchy in team!

On the best teams, different individuals provide occasional leadership, taking charge in areas where they have particular strengths. 

> The structure of a team is a network, not a hierarchy!

> A little bit of heterogeneity can be an enormous aid to create a jelled team.

# Part V Fertile Soil

Projects and teams exist within a context provided by the larger organization called the corporate culture. 

Some cultures support healthy work while others may make it almost impossible.

## Chapter 29

### Over-automation

Deterministic and Nondeterministic Systems

When you automate a previously all-human system, it becomes entirely deterministic. 

The new system is capable of making only those responses planned explicitly by its builders.

Automators spend much of their time thinking through situations that are so unlikely or occur so rarely that the human elements of the old system never even bothered to consider them unless and until they actually happened.

If the business policy governing the new system has a sufficient degree of natural adhoc-cracy, it is a mistake to automate it.

### Methodology

A _Methodology_ is a general systems theory of how a whole class of thought-intensive work ought to be conducted. 

- A "fat book".

- An attempt to centralize thinking.

- People are not smart enough to do the thinking.

- Can do grievous damage to efforts in which the people are fully competent.

- Tries to force the work into a fixed mold that guarantees:
 
  1. Paperwork
  2. Methods
  3. No Responsibility - blame the Methodology
  4. No Motivation

- The view that knowledge is so valuable, we must use it sparingly.

- **Malicious Compliance:** People will do exactly what the Methodology says, even when they know doing so is a waste of time.

- The obsession with Methodologies in the workplace is another instance of the "high-tech illusion".

### Convergence of Method

- A good thing. 

- Methodologies are not the only way.

- Better ways:
  
  1. Training
  2. Tools
  3. Peer Review

- A standard is defined as a proven method for undertaking a repeated task demonstrated widely and successfully within a company.

- Hunting out new approaches and imposing them as standards before anyone in the organization has even tried them out. 

**Hawthorne Effect:** People perform better when they are trying something new.

The total of all standards imposed upon your people should be described in no more than ten pages.


## Chapter 30

The One Risk We Almost Never Manage

The risk we tend not to manage is the risk of our own failure.


## Chapter 31

Some organizations are so addicted to meetings that work has to take second place. They hold meetings that have little purpose and no clearly defined end-state. 

At the other extreme, some organizations are so fearful of the waste of meetings that they refuse to use the “M” word at all. The middle is the only safe ground.

Stand-Up Meetings

A somewhat new wrinkle is the stand-up meeting, typically conducted in an empty space (no tables or chairs) with all participants on their feet. 

The theory is that no one gets too comfortable and so the tendency to prattle on is reduced.

Even short stand-ups can be a drag on an organization’s effectiveness if they lack purpose and focus. 

So what should the purpose and focus of a meeting be? That’s going to depend on what kind of a meeting it is.

Basic Meeting Hygiene

A meeting that is specifically called to get something done might be called a working meeting.

A working meeting is typically called to _reach a decision_.

If you can say definitively what group action terminates the meeting, then it’s a working meeting. If you can’t, it isn’t.

Ceremonies

A meeting that is ended by the clock is a ceremony. Its purpose is not to get any particular thing decided. It’s all FYI. 

The FYIing often happens in a ritualistic manner: quick intro and announcements by a boss, followed by serial one-on-one interactions between the boss and each subordinate. At any given moment, two people are involved. The others are nominally listening, with emphasis on the nominally. 

There is occasionally a real need for ceremony in the workplace. A ceremony might be called to celebrate some accomplishment, to lay out a strategic change of direction, or to evaluate a project at its end. All of these justifiable ceremonies are a bit out of the ordinary. That’s what makes them justifiable. 

It is the regular ceremony that needs to be suspect.

An example of a regular ceremony is the weekly (or daily!) status meeting, with ten or twenty people locked in a room taking turns talking to the boss.


## Chapter 32

The ultimate management sin is wasting people’s time.

> It is not a meeting; it is a ceremony

> Meetings meet manager's need for reassurance. 

Status meeting:

- purpose is to reach consenus
- ad-hoc; not regularly scheduled

> When bosses are needy, nonattendence is regarded as a threat. 

A fragmented team is teamicidal and is guaranteed to waste the individual's time from switching gears. 

The human capital invested in your work force represents a ton of money. 

The weekly status meeting is an obvious example. Though its goal may seem to be status reporting, its real intent is status confirming. And it’s not the status of the work, but the status of the boss.

Early Overstaffing

Meetings are not the only way that people’s time gets wasted. When staff is brought on too quickly at the beginning of a project, there is almost always a waste of people’s time. 

You might think this is an easy sin to avoid: Just figure out how quickly the work can absorb new people; then bring them on, only at that rate. Although this makes perfectly good sense, it is often politically infeasible.


## Chapter 33

Corporate Spam

Most of the spam in your In-box comes from co-workers.

An easy test for corporate spam is to apply some secure-organization thinking. When security is key, information is routed on a need-to-know basis. Imagine going through today’s e-mail onslaught, asking about each and every arriving message, 

“Do I need to know this?” The ones that don’t pass this test are spam. 

Is This an Open Organization or a Commune?

The phrase “open organization” has a warm touchy-feely sound to it. It’s nice if people allow you to pull information from them about what they’re doing, but less nice if they push it on you.

> Life is short. If you need to know everything in order to do anything, you’re not going to get much done.


## Chapter 34

People Hate Change

They are not rejecting a particular change on its merits; they’re rejecting any change.

- Resistance to change
- Satir change model (Figure 34-3)

> The fundamental response to change is not logical but emotional. 

The reason the Satir model is so important is that it alerts us that Chaos is an integral part of change.

It is frustrating and embarassing to abandon approaches and methods you have long since mastered, only to become a novice again.


## Chapter 35

Experience gets turned into learning when an organization alters itself:

- instills new skills and approaches in its people
- redesigns itself

> Learning is limited by an organization's ability to keep its people. 

The Management Team = made up of middle-management

Teams of managers = teamicidal effects

> One thing team needs to jell: ownership of work product. 

Learning happens in the white space. 


## Chapter 36
 
"Politics, the Noble Science" by Aristotle

5 noble sciences: metaphysics, logic, ethics, politics, and aesthetics

> Aristotelian politics is the key practice of good management.

# Part VI: It’s Supposed to Be Fun to Work Here

## Chapter 37

Constructive reintroduction of small amounts of disorder:

- pilot projects
- war games
- brainstorming
- training, trips, conferences, and retreats

Pilot Projects

- Documentary consistency but not functional consistency.

- Do not experiment with more than one aspect of development technology. 


## Chapter 38
 
- loosely stated responsibilities so that the individual has a strong say in defining the work. 

- blank check

> The mark of the best manager is an ability to single out the few key spirits and turn them loose: get out of their way. 


----------



## Chapter 29
 
- To extrapolate from the success of interface standards to the need for process standards is a bit of a stretch. 

- Identifying an ideal practice is a useful endeavor, but mandating such a practice is a bad idea.

- Competent people are involved with process improvement all the time. 

- Formal process improvement moves responsibility from the individual to the organization (institutionalize). 

- Higher proficiency is unlikely to reduce risk.

- The more you improve the way you go about your work, the harder the work will be. 

- As we make progress in process improvement, we need more talented people to do the work.

- Focus on the Key Process Areas (KPAs), but turn off the institutional score-keeping.

The projects most worth doing are the ones that will move you DOWN one full level on your process scale.

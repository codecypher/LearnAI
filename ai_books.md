## Software Engineering Ethics

There seems to be a general problem with ethics in computer science in general but specifically in software engineering. A majority of researchers have admitted to manipulating data, and I worked with a professor who manipulated results for some NIH grants. I come across ethics problems a lot as a software engineer (and you will too) even when working on government projects, so I end up looking for another job.

Read the preface in "The Clean Coder" about the NASA shuttle disaster. Also think about the SpaceX shuttles that have blown up - there could have been people on board. SpaceX is a train wreck that needs to be put out of business.

There are a lot of similarities in autonomous vehicles. In fact, there are now quite a few car companies dropping their AV projects which is probably for the best.

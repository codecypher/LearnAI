# Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

[Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning?wprov=sfti1) (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. 

The three basic machine learning paradigms are: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 

RL differs from supervised learning:

- RL does not need labeled input/output pairs. 

- RL focuses on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).

The environment is typically stated in the form of a _Markov decision process (MDP)_ since many RL algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. 


## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence approach that focuses on the learning of the system through its interactions with the environment.

In reinforcement learning, the system’s parameters are adapted based on the feedback obtained from the environment which in turn provides feedback on the decisions made by the system. 

The following diagram shows a person making decisions in order to arrive at their destination.

One day you and decide to try a different route with a view to finding the shortest path. 

This dilemma of trying out new routes or sticking to the best-known route is an example of **exploration** versus **exploitation**:



## What makes Reinforcement Learning so hard?

The main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and RL algorithms is that RL does not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.

For every state, we want the ability to make a good decision. Decisions are made sequentially: we order a combination of products, observe the products sold, and at the end of the day we must be able to make a re-order decision for every possible scenario that may unfold.

Thus, _deterministic_ optimization provides decisions whereas _stochastic_ optimization provides decision-making policies. 

Deterministic optimization solves a single problem whereas stochastic optimization solves all problems that may arise. 

> RL does not tell us _what_ decisions to make but _how_ to make them. 


## Summary

- The goal of RL is to find a policy that works under any circumstance rather than just a decision which makes it much harder than deterministic optimization.

- RL is usually applied in noisy stochastic environments and ML algorithms have a tendency to fit the noise rather than the controllable patterns.

- Challenges in RL are the many different subfields (no uniform language or toolbox), problem representation in mathematical form, and the reliance on limited real-world observations to learn policies.

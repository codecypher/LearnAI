# The Alchemy of AI

## Background

The student of AI needs the following:

- A healthy dose of skepticism [4].

- Knowledge of the history and reasons that led to the _AI Winter_.

- Be aware of the hype, misinformation, and  alchemy that is common in the field of AI.

The two guiding principles of AI engineering are:

1. Occam's Razor
2. No Free Lunch Theorem
